# TRAFFIC-SIGN-RECOGNITION-SYSTEMâ€¢

Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) describes the characteristics and requirements and difficulties between road sign identification and recognition of the road signs. 
It shows the convolutional neural network technique used for the verification and classification of road signs. 
The paper introduces a traffic sign detection and recognition system that accurately estimates the situation and exact boundary of traffic signs using a convolutional neural network (CNN). 
during this Python project, we'll build a deep neural network model which will classify traffic signs present within the image into different categories. 
With this model, we are ready to read and understand traffic signs, which is an important task for all autonomous vehicles.
